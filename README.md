The Odin Project HTML Foundations final project: Create a basic website with 3 recipes. 

Rules:
- Create a directory names "odin-recipes"
- Create an index.html file using the usual boilerplate, and add an h1 header called "Odin Recipes"
- Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory title "recipes"
- Create new files within the "recipes" folder that are named after the recipes that you will be documenting. Make sure the title for the pages are the recipe names.
- Each recipe page should have the following content:
    - An image of the finished dish under an h1 heading
    - Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized description heading, followed by a paragraph or two that describes the recipe
    - Under the description, add an "Ingredients" heading, followed by an unordered list of the required ingredients.
    - Finally, under the ingredients, add a "Steps" heading, followed by an ordered list of the steps needed to create the dish.
- There should be a total of 3 recipes that follow the same format
- Add all Recipe pages to the index page. Consider adding them using an unordered list, so that they aren't all on the same line.
