    <h2>A Shinobi's Best Friend</h2>
    <p><em>While traipsing around Ashina a shinobi will undoubtedly become parched and famished, and when the healing
        gourd goes dry you will want a healthy supply of <strong>pellets</strong>. These savory snacks are chock-full
        nutty-goodness and are accented with a bit of white chocolate and cranberry.</em></p>
    <h3><u>Ingredients:</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- Note you can use "Entities" like the fractional numbers here-->
        <li>&frac14; cup macadamia nuts </li>
        <li>&frac14; cup sunflower seeds</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup cashews</li>
        <li>&frac23; cup almond butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1 tsp almond extract</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup ground flax seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp white sesame seeds</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup dried cranberries</li>
        <li>&frac34; cup white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>Steps:</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the <strong>macadamia nuts</strong>, <strong>sunflower seeds</strong>, and <strong>cashews</strong> 
            in a food processor. Pulse until the nuts are completely crumbled. Add the rest of the ingredients and blend 
            until completely combined.</li>
        <br><li>Transfer the mixture into a bowl to make sure you donâ€™t cut yourself with the blade of the food 
            processor. Take about a tablespoon of the mixture and form a ball in your hand. Place on a tray 
            with parchment paper. Repeat this with the rest of the mixture.</li>
        <br><li>Add some white sesame seeds to a ziplock bag. Take each ball and toss it until covered with sesame 
            seeds. Place back on the tray with parchment paper. Repeat this with the remaining balls. Chill 
            for one hour.</li>
        <br><li>Transfer the balls into a airtight container. <em>Can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</em></li>
